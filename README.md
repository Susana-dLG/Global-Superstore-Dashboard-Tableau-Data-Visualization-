# 📊 Global Superstore Dashboard – Tableau Visualization Project

## 1️⃣ Project Overview

This project explores the **Global Superstore** dataset to uncover key insights into:
- 📦 Sales performance by region
- 💹 Profit margins by product category
- 🚚 Shipping costs and delivery trends
- 🔥 Order prioritization patterns

The objective is to provide a **comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing business outcomes** for a global retail operation. Using **Tableau**, I developed four interactive visualizations, each offering actionable insights through filters, interactivity, and visual clarity.

## 2️⃣ Dashboard Visualizations & Outcomes

### 📌 Visual 1: **Sales by Region**

- **Insight:**  
  Western Europe, Central America, and Oceania are the top-performing regions.  
  The bar height reflects **total sales**, while the color stacks show yearly contributions from 2012 to 2015.

### 📌 Visual 2: **Profit Margin by Category**

- **Insight:**  
  The **Technology** category shows the **highest profit margins**, followed by Office Supplies.  
  Furniture, despite high sales, lags in profit—highlighting potential cost inefficiencies.

### 📌 Visual 3: **Shipping Cost Analysis**

- **Insight:**  
  Standard Class maintains the **lowest average shipping cost**, while Same Day and First Class are significantly more expensive.  
  Over time, costs for most shipping methods remain relatively stable, except a slight drop in 2016.

---

### 📌 Visual 4: **Order Priority Breakdown**
![Order Priority Breakdown](screenshots/Screenshot%202025-06-12%20192316.png)

- **Insight:**  
  A majority (**57%**) of orders are labeled **Medium priority**, while **Critical** and **Low** orders represent a much smaller share.  
  This suggests most operations run on standard urgency, with a smaller share requiring high-speed or flagged handling.

## 3️⃣ Key Insights from the Dashboard

- 🌍 **Sales are heavily region-dependent**, with Western Europe and Central America leading performance.
- 📈 **Technology products yield the highest profit**, despite Furniture driving higher sales volumes.
- 🚚 **Shipping optimization potential exists**, especially in costly modes like Same Day.
- 🔁 **Most orders are Medium priority**, which may reflect balanced customer demand without extreme urgency.
